## What is Hyperledger Fabric:
- Hyperledger is a set of tools that allows us to run a distributed database that scales utilizing blockchain technologies.
- It also allows us to have much greater flexibility with our data sharing across multi tenant systems.
- Hyperledger is essentially a shared database.
- 2 basic components of any working network are going to be the `orders` and `peers`.
- `peers` receive verify transactions in the network and then hand them off to the `orders` which process them and decide which order they are written to the block chain. `orders` then pass them back to the `peers` who write them to their `ledger`.
- Each `peer` has it's own `ledger`.
